# hospitalreceptionist
This is an academic projects done totally by me during my junior year at NJIT. It consists of a website built for receptionists of an imaginary hospital, after the recpetionist logs in using personal credentials, the server connects to mySql database and allows the receptionist to look for patients, add new patients, add/cancel procedures and appointments and many other modifications to the hospitals' database. It is currently published on my website:
